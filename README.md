# py-hearts
## play the card game hearts, with just some computers with internet connections
##### Built for python 3.5
======
### Usage
#### Server
1. Clone or download and extract the repo
2. Open the src/server/ directory
3. Run server.py with python 3+ (if you receive errors, use python 3.5 specifically)
4. Ensure port 3033 is accessible through any gateway/router your server computer is connected to

#### Client
1. Open the src/client/ directory from your downloaded repo
2. Take a copy of client.py and distribute this to all client machines
3. On each client machine, run client.py with python 3+ (again, python 3.5 if you get errors)
4. Enter a username, then enter the IP of the server machine (local works if on the same network, global works regardless)
 - Note: you should **not** add the port on the end, this is handled separately
